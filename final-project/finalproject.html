<p>The Major League Baseball Players Union and Major League Baseball came to an agreement on June 23rd to have a 60 game MLB regular season. The timeline of the season began on July 1st with players reporting to training camp, opening day commencing on July 23rd, with the culmination of the season on September 27th. The final agreement between both parties that was originally proposed in March, concludes a long bumpy process that involved a lot of tension, social media backlash, and badmouthing between the players and the owners. Additionally, while this small battle might be over, some may argue that the war has only just begun, with the current CBA set to expire in December 2021. However, in order to fully grasp the drama that took place these past few months leading up to the eventual agreement, it is crucial to understand the years of baggage between the two sides that has created this deep rift.</p>

<p>People can point the finger at many different reasons as to why baseball’s players and owners have disliked each other for so long. Originally, there was the reserve clause, which was a condition in all contracts that enabled owners to hold onto the rights of their players past the extent of that player's contract, even if they only signed for one year. This left the player with no right to change teams unless given an unconditional release, making it difficult for players to hit the open market, ultimately saving money for their owners. For a while there was owner collusion, reduced free agency salaries, restricted player movements, and bonuses promised to players that were never delivered, until the players finally formed their own union. In 1966, Marvin Miller was elected as the Executive Director of the Major League Baseball Players Association until 1982. Under Miller's direction, the players' union transformed into one of the strongest unions in the United States, specifically with the arrival of free agency in the 1970’s. Following the beginning of free agency, players began to get some leverage in negotiations with the owners, and thus started the trend of strikes and disputes, leading to eight different work stoppages in Major League Baseball since 1972, including the only cancellation of a major sports league postseason and world championship in 1994-95.
