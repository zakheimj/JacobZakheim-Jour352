<p>
<span class="first-letter">T</span>he Major League Baseball Players Association and Major League Baseball came to an agreement on June 23rd to have a 60 game MLB regular season. The season began on July 1st with players reporting to training camp, followed by opening day on July 23rd, with the culmination of the regular season on September 27th. The agreement between both parties concludes a long bumpy process that involved a lot of tension, social media backlash, and badmouthing between the players and the owners. In order to fully grasp the drama that took place these past few months leading up to the eventual agreement, it is crucial to understand the years of built up baggage between the two sides that has created this rift.

<p>People can point the finger at many different reasons as to why baseball’s players and owners have disliked each other for so long. At first there was the reserve clause, a condition in all contracts that enabled owners to hold onto the rights of their players past the extent of that player's contract, even if they only signed for one year. This left the player with no right to change teams unless given an unconditional release, making it difficult for players to hit the open market. Following years of reduced free agency salaries, restricted player movements, and bonuses promised to players that were never delivered, the players finally formed their own union. In 1966, Marvin Miller was elected as the Executive Director of the Major League Baseball Players Association until 1982. Under Miller's direction, the players' union transformed into one of the strongest unions in the United States, specifically with the arrival of free agency in the 1970’s. Following the beginning of free agency, players began to gain some leverage in negotiations with the owners, thus starting and maintaining the trend of strikes and disputes, leading to eight different work stoppages in Major League Baseball since 1972.

<p>1972 was the first strike in Major League Baseball history. The players led this strike, which went from April 1st to April 13th, in hopes of receiving improved pension benefits. The owners eventually caved, realizing that the cost of paying extra pension was less than the price of missing games. Both sides ultimately agreed to a $500,000 increase in pensions, and owners additionally agreed to add salary arbitration to the CBA, giving an independent arbitrator the decision of choosing between the requested salary of the player or the owner during a contract dispute. 86 total games were lost during this stoppage. This was a decision on behalf of the owners that they would later on regret.</p>&nbsp
</a>

<a id="strike2-sect">
<div class= "mlb-chapheadline"> Strike #2: 1973</div>
<p>A year after the implementation of the salary arbitration rule, the owners went on strike, locking the players out of spring training in February until a new CBA was agreed on, specifically dealing with the rules on how salary arbitration would work in the future. By the end of the month the two sides agreed on a new three year CBA deal, one clearly defining the rules behind the salary arbitration process with a neutral arbitrator deciding between the player's request and the owner's offer. Spring training games resumed and ultimately no regular season games were missed.</p></a>

<a id="strike3-sect">
<div class= "mlb-chapheadline"> Strike #3: 1976</div>
<p>‘76 marked a real turning point in the relationship between the players and owners. It began with MLBPA Executive Director Marvin Miller finding a weakness in the reserve clause, giving much-needed leverage to the players in contract negotiations. Specifically, following the arbitration ruling of pitchers Andy Messermith and Dave Mcnally, it marked the first time in history where the independent arbitrator ruled in favor of the players, laying the foundation for free agency. While Mcnally ultimately retired following the decision, Messermith quickly cashed in, signing a three year deal worth one million dollars, a hefty raise from his previous salary of $90,000 in 1974. The owners, unsure of how to react to losing the arbitration battle, decided to lock the players out of Spring training in early March, but ended the strike before the regular season began, as the owners realized again that cancelling regular season games only increased their financial losses. While zero games in 1976 were missed, the flaw that Miller found in the highly dreaded reserve clause makes this strike one of the most substantial in MLB history.</p>

<a id="strike4-sect">
<div class= "mlb-chapheadline"> Strike #4: 1980</div>
<p>The installment of free agency a couple of years back and the heated negotiations over a new CBA, caused the players to go on strike in 1980 for the last eight days of spring training. Players threatened to go on strike again if a new deal wasn’t reached by late May. The sides eventually reached an agreement on everything except free agency compensation, and the strike ended before the start of the regular season. However, decided upon in the agreement, was that the players union and the owners would create a committee to work on the free agency compensation issue, something that would ultimately create more problems in the next season.</p>&nbsp
</a>

<a id="strike5-sect">
<div class= "mlb-chapheadline"> Strike #5: 1981</div>
<p>As the owners and players continued to remain lengths apart on an agreement surrounding free agency compensation, the players ultimately had enough. The issue around the compensation wasn’t about money, but was about what a team would receive once they lost a free agent. Without being agreed upon, the owners implemented a rule, enforcing a team that just signed a free agent to then give up a draft pick and current player in return. The players union responded with a strike on June 11th, and didn’t return to the diamond until August 11th. This serves as another monumental moment in baseball history, as the players missed out on their first two paychecks and there was no All-star game that season.</p>

</div>


<p>Furthermore, once the season did resume, the restart was a mess as a total of 717 games were missed and different teams had played an uneven number of games. Ultimately the league decided to split the season in two halves, giving playoff bids to the teams leading their division in each half of the season.
</p>&nbsp


<a id="strike6-sect">
<div class= "mlb-chapheadline"> Strike #6: 1985</div>
<p>While the 1985 stoppage may be the shortest of them all, its ripple effects are considered to be as big as any Major League Baseball strike that we have ever seen. Following the massive six year one billion dollar television deal that the MLB signed in 1983, the players wanted to keep their same percentage of television money that they agreed to in the previous deal, one third of the total TV income. However, following negotiation, the players agreed to an 18% number, receiving around $196 million dollars in TV money over those six years. On the other hand, during the negotiation the owners tried to implement a salary cap and arbitration cap number which would put limits on the amount of money they can pay their players, but that deal was rejected. Lastly, the league also increased the minimum league salary from $40,000 to $60,000. So while the strike of ‘85 only lasted 2 days and no games were missed, it created tension between the owners and commissioner at the time, Peter Ueberroth, leading to a National League owner telling the Chicago Tribune that Ueberroth is, “A no-good s.o.b., We could have gotten the whole thing but Ueberroth forced the settlement for his personal benefit. All he cares about is making a big reputation himself”. Following this strike, the owners were then found guilty of colluding for the next three seasons up until 1987. Owners agreed to not sign each other’s players in order to drive down the market price of the athletes. Following the collusion scandal, where the owners ultimately paid the players $280 million dollars worth of reparations, the player-owner relationship scoured to a new level. Any trust that had been built up to that point was gone, and many attribute this moment to what would come around 10 years later, during the 1994-95 MLB work stoppage.

<a id="strike7-sect">
<div class= "mlb-chapheadline"> Strike #7: 1990</div>
<p>Nothing too outrageous happened during this strike, as it was brought upon by the owners due to free agency and arbitration. Opening day was ultimately pushed off a week, but the two sides quickly came to an agreement and no games were lost.</p>&nbsp

“It was a really difficult time for the game,” Manfred told The LA Times. “I think it was the one time in our modern history that the game actually took a step backward.”

<a id="strike8-sect">
<div class= "mlb-chapheadline"> Strike #8: 1994-95</div>
<p>The last work stoppage we’ve had, and the most devastating one to date. On August 12th, 1994 the players went on strike after the owners once again tried to implement a salary cap. The owners believed that the increasing salaries of players were really hurting the small market teams, but the players resisted. Major League Baseball did not return until April 1995, the longest lockout in professional sports until the NHL in 2004-05. The postseason and World Series were cancelled in 1994, marking itself as one of the darkest times in the history of professional sports. Current MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred at the time worked for a law firm representing the owners during those negotiations. “It was a really difficult time for the game,” Manfred told The LA Times. “I think it was the one time in our modern history that the game actually took a step backward.” Eventually the players got their wishes, as no salary cap was instituted, yet a total of 921 games were lost in the combined seasons. “The only good thing about this strike is that we haven't seen another work stoppage since it finally ended,” Ryan Fagan of SportingNews wrote.

<div class= "mlb-chapheadline">The Current State:</div>
<p>Learning the history of this relationship can help one understand the current animosity and pettiness that has taken place during the 2020 MLB off-season. Due to the Coronavirus, the MLB players and owners negotiated on how much the players would be paid for a shortened season. The biggest difference between the two sides? The players want 100 percent prorated salaries for the season, meaning the players get paid for each game that they play, while the owners tried to bring that prorated number down to between 70 and 80 percent. In March, the players and owners agreed on a deal that Commissioner Rob Manfred can unilaterally schedule a season of any length, as long as the players got full prorated salaries. From March until June 15th, a soft deadline created, the players and owners would try and negotiate a deal that would make both sides happy. The owners made an effort, making three separate offers to the players’ union, however the MLBPA ultimately rejected all three. Realizing that losing more games would only hurt the organizations more, in terms of revenue loss from streaming rights and profitability, both parties agreed to leave Commissioner Rob Manfred in charge as stated in the March agreement. Manfred instituted the 60 game season with full prorated salaries.

&nbsp <p>The process wasn’t easy, as fans, players and MLB officials took their opinions to social media, making this negotiation the most public one in league history. Many believe that this negotiation was just the preamble to what will take place next December as the current CBA is set to expire. Whether that is true or not, the truth of the matter is that in a little over two weeks Major League Baseball will be back, at least for now.
